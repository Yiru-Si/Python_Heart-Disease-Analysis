# Python_Heart-Disease-Analysis
Heart Disease Analysis in the U.S. (2022) - Optimizing AEDs (Automated External Defibrillators) allocation and launching targeted public service announcements.

## Objective
AEDs (Automated External Defibrillators) play a critical role in saving lives during cardiac emergencies. Laws and regulations requiring the presence of AEDs in public gathering places have been enacted in all fifty states in the U.S. As an data analyst in an AED supplier, my responsibility was:  
* To develop an up-to-date allocation plan for AEDs by analyzing the prevalence of heart disease in each state.
* To identify and prioritize the most influential factors contributing to heart disease for the public service announcements.

## Data Sources
* The dataset originally comes from 2022 annual CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) survey, including data from over 400,000 adults regarding their health status. It is a major component of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS): https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease/data
* Heart Disease Prevalence Dataset from CDC: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/hus/topics/heart-disease-prevalence.htm  

## Data  
* Dataset from the survey includes 40 variables associated with heart disease: gender, age category, BMI, Physical Activity as well as various pre-existing diseases such as Angina, Stroke, Diabetes etc.
* Dataset of heart disease prevalence contains average data of gender, age groups and regions with regard to the heart disease rate during 1997-2019.
